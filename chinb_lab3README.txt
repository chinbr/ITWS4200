I finished installing github and creating an account on git.
I created the repository ITWS4200 on github.com and cloned it to a local repository, using the github application. 
After that, I added rplotka@ts400.com as a contributer.


We decided to name our project "Find".

I received an invitation from ddbuce/find (our group repository) and cloned it as a local repository. rplotka was given permission to access the repository by adding as a contributer.

Madi configured the server on myhosting.rpi.org by signing up and logging in through her RPI username. The domain is find.myrpi.org
The login is:
vastam
webscience


We decided to use bugzilla as our bug tracker. We ran into problems trying to run it on the server.
